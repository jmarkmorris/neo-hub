# Brainstorming a Project

- I might do this. 
- I might think on it a while.

# Goals / Prompt

- My goal is to create my own well formatted website that serves all of my content both natively and with reference to other sites (WordPress, YouTube, ArXiv, etc.) 
- The hub might retrieve that content from github, where it would also be available in markdown.
- Not only do I want to serve all of my own content but I want to use Ai in several different ways.  
    - First, if/when I review each article I will use Ai to rewrite the article in an improved style, possibly updating terminology or linking new images. 
    - Second, in parallel to serving my own content, I want the content available on github so I can have Ai LLMs access it to generate textbook chapters, focused articles, social media, and new images or videos.
- I will use Ai where feasible and otherwise plugins, packages, and libraries.

# Gemini Consulting

Incorporating your specific goals with a heavy emphasis on AI opens up exciting possibilities. This is about creating an **AI-enhanced content pipeline and delivery system.**

Hereâ€™s a set of recommendations focusing on your AI-centric workflow:

**Core Philosophy:** Treat GitHub as your primary, version-controlled, AI-accessible "source of truth" for content (in Markdown). Your custom website will pull from this source. WordPress becomes the initial data source to be migrated *from*.

**AI-Powered Content Transformation & Enhancement (Iterative)**

*This is where your first AI goal comes into play. Process articles one by one or in batches.*

1.  **Select an Article:** Choose a Markdown file from your `content/posts/` directory in the local repository.
2.  **AI Rewriting & Enhancement:**
    *   **Tooling:** Use a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, etc., via their API or a tool like ChatGPT Plus.
    *   **Prompt Engineering is Key:**
        *   Provide the LLM with the *entire text content* of the Markdown file (excluding front matter for the main rewrite, but potentially providing it as context).
        *   **Instruct the AI clearly:**
            *   "Rewrite this article in a [specify style - e.g., more engaging, professional, concise, expert] tone."
            *   "Update any outdated terminology regarding [specific topic]."
            *   "Improve the flow and clarity."
            *   "Ensure accuracy regarding [specific facts/concepts]."
            *   "Suggest 2-3 places where a new, relevant image could enhance understanding. Describe the desired image content for each suggestion."
            *   "Maintain the original core message and information."
            *   "Output the result in Markdown format."
    *   **Review & Iterate:** The AI's output is a draft. Review it carefully for accuracy, style, and coherence. You may need to refine the prompt and run it again or manually edit the output.
3.  **AI Image Generation & Integration:**
    *   Based on the AI's suggestions (or your own ideas during review), use AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion) to create the new visuals.
    *   **Prompting Image AI:** Use the descriptions generated/refined in the previous step.
    *   **Save & Link:** Save the generated images to your `assets/images/` folder (perhaps in a dated or topic-based subfolder). Update the Markdown file, inserting the image using the correct relative Markdown syntax (e.g., `![Alt text for image](../../assets/images/subfolder/new-image.jpg)`). Adjust the relative path based on your folder structure.
4.  **Link Verification/Update:** Manually check internal links to ensure they point to the correct relative paths of other Markdown files within your repo. AI *might* be able to assist in identifying potentially broken links if prompted correctly, but verification is crucial.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Once satisfied with the rewritten text and new images/links for an article, commit the updated `.md` file and any new image files to your GitHub repository with a descriptive message (e.g., "feat: AI rewrite and enhance article 'article-slug'").

**Building Your Custom Website**

1.  **Technology Choice:** Select a modern web framework that handles Markdown well and can easily fetch data. Excellent choices include:
    *   **Next.js (React):** Very popular, great ecosystem, supports SSG (Static Site Generation) and SSR (Server-Side Rendering). Can fetch data at build time or runtime.
    *   **Astro:** Content-focused, excellent performance ("islands architecture"), built-in Markdown/MDX support, fetches data at build time (great for SSG).
    *   **SvelteKit:** Growing popularity, compiles to vanilla JS, good performance, supports SSG/SSR.
    *   **Nuxt.js (Vue):** Similar capabilities to Next.js, but for the Vue ecosystem.
2.  **Fetching Content from GitHub:**
    *   **Build Time (Recommended for Performance/Simplicity):** Configure your build process (often using GitHub Actions for deployment) to:
        *   Clone your `my-ai-content-hub` repository.
        *   Have your chosen framework read the Markdown files from the `content/` directory during the build. Libraries like `gray-matter` (for front matter) and `marked`, `remark`, or `unified` (for Markdown parsing) are essential.
        *   Generate static HTML pages for each article.
    *   **Runtime (More complex, allows real-time updates without rebuilds):** Use the GitHub API within your website's backend/serverless functions to fetch Markdown file content on demand. Requires handling API rate limits and authentication.
3.  **Rendering:** Your chosen framework will use the parsed Markdown content and front matter to render the HTML pages, applying your custom CSS for styling.
4.  **AI Assistance in Development:** Use tools like GitHub Copilot or ask ChatGPT/Claude for help with:
    *   Writing framework-specific code (components, data fetching logic).
    *   Debugging issues.
    *   Generating boilerplate code.
    *   CSS styling ideas or implementation.

**Leveraging GitHub Content for AI Generation (Ongoing)**

1.  **GitHub as Knowledge Base:** Your structured Markdown files in the GitHub repo now act as a curated, version-controlled knowledge base.
2.  **Access Methods for LLMs:**
    *   **Manual Copy/Paste:** For one-off tasks, copy the relevant Markdown content and paste it into an LLM interface (ChatGPT, Claude) with specific instructions.
    *   **GitHub API + Scripting:** Write scripts (e.g., Python) that use the GitHub API to fetch specific files or search the repository, then feed that content to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) for processing.
    *   **LangChain / LlamaIndex:** These frameworks are designed to connect LLMs to custom data sources. You can configure them to index your GitHub repository (either by cloning it locally or using integrations) and then query your content store. This is powerful for complex Q&A or generation tasks over your entire content base.
    *   **Local Clone + LLM:** Clone the repo locally and use tools or scripts that read local files and interact with LLM APIs.
3.  **AI Generation Tasks:**
    *   **Prompting:** Provide the LLM with context (one or more relevant Markdown articles) and clear instructions:
        *   "Using the provided articles on [topic], write a 500-word focused article summarizing the key challenges."
        *   "Generate a chapter outline for a textbook based on the content in the `content/posts/advanced-topic/` directory."
        *   "Create 3 short promotional blurbs for social media about the article '[article-slug].md'."
        *   "Based on the descriptions in this article, generate prompts for an AI image generator to create suitable illustrations." (Then feed these prompts to Midjourney/DALL-E).
        *   "Generate a script outline for a short explanatory video based on '[article-slug].md'." (Could potentially feed this to AI video generation tools later).
4.  **Output Handling:** Save the generated text, image prompts, or scripts as needed. You might even commit useful generated summaries or alternate versions back into a separate part of your GitHub repo.

**Key Considerations in this AI-Centric Approach:**

*   **Cost:** Extensive use of premium LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude 3) and image generation tools can incur costs. Monitor usage.
*   **Quality Control:** AI output *always* requires human review and editing for accuracy, tone, and coherence. Don't blindly trust the output.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of your AI results depends heavily on how well you phrase your instructions (prompts). This is a skill to develop.
*   **Iteration:** Expect this to be an iterative process. You'll refine prompts, tweak the AI output, and adjust your workflow as you go.
*   **Tooling Choice:** Select LLMs and frameworks you are comfortable with or willing to learn.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git diligently. Commit frequently with clear messages. Use branches for experiments (e.g., trying different AI rewrite styles).

This approach transforms your blog migration into a dynamic content creation and management system with AI deeply integrated at multiple points, aligning perfectly with your stated goals.
